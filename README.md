# React Random Quote Generator

Random Quote Generator is a 2 day sprint in which you will solidify your understanding of React and get creative with HTML/CSS.
The main goal is to have a functional random quote machine which displays a new random quote (about a topic of your choice) on
the press of a button.

## Objectives

- Understand how React works
- Learn how to store and manipulate the state of an application
- Carefully consider how to create reusable components
- Consider how a user interacts with an application
- Work on your HTML/CSS skills

## Stages

1. Make sure you are comfortable with how the shopping list demo works, and then read the [Thinking in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html) article again.
2. Think about what React components you will need for your random quote application and build them out, initially with no state.
3. For this project, we will not be making any API requests. Think about where you want the state of your project to live, how you want it to look (hint: for random access, an array is an ideal data structure), and build your state into your project.
4. Once your app is displaying one random quote, allow the user to randomize the quote on the click of a button.
5. Finally, style your app nicely so someone would really want to use it.


## Running the project

Start the HTTP server:
```
$ npm run server
```

Navigate to http://localhost:4000
